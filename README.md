Data Adjustments and Limitations
-


1. Some records showed negative ages with birthdates after the year 2060. These were adjusted by subtracting 100 years, changing the years to the 1960s, which makes more sense.

2. Some termination dates were set far in the future and were excluded from the analysis (1357 records). Only termination dates up to the current date were considered.
